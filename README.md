# Airbnb-Project
The repository must have a README.md file that communicates the libraries used, the motivation for the project, the files in the repository with a small description of each, a summary of the results of the analysis, and necessary acknowledgements. 

The repository contains a readme and project file. 
The project analysis the spread of airbnb units in City of Seattle and identifies the answers for the following business question

1. Which neighbourhood would an affluent traveller (ie a traveller willing to spend more on accomodation) to Seattle most likely find his place of stay via airbnb?
2. What is the types of accomadation available to his choice if he is willing to spend more?
3. Do owners in Airbnb (especially low priced accomodation) try to compensate their low priced rentals by imposing minimum stay restrictions. Eg: Do low priced accomadation require tenants to higher number of minimum nights stay compared to high priced accomodation.
