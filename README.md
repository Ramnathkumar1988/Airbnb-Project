# Libraries Used
Folium: It is used for creating for plotting data on maps, in this case plotting airbnb locations based on latitude and lingitude in map of seattle
Jenkspy: The algorithm is used to create frequency distribution. It divides the given set of number into n number of groups where n is defined by the user. It does so by identifying the points where the data can be split, resulting in groups with least variance of within group elements. It does this by using an iterative process till least variance is obtained within each group.
OS: OS library is used to get the current path.
Pandas: Used to create dataframe for better analyzing of data.
